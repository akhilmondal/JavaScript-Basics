Javscript async/await
-----------------------

* Async
  --------------------------------------------
  - We use the async keyword with a function to represent that the function is an asynchronous function.
  - The async function returns a promise.

* Await
  -----
  - The await keyword is used inside the async function to wait for the asynchronous operation.
  - Note: You can use await only inside of async functions.


* Error Handling
  --------------
  - While using the async function, you write the code in a synchronous manner.
    And you can also use the catch() method to catch the error.
  - The other way you can handle an error is by using try/catch block.

TIPS: These two keywords async/await were introduced in the newer version of JavaScript (ES8).
