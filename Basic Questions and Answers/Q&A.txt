Q1. What is Express JS ?  

A: - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
   - Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
                                          OR
   - Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js, which allows you to build web applications and APIs quickly and easily. 
     It provides a set of features and tools that simplify the process of handling HTTP requests, routing, and managing responses. Express.
     js is known for its simplicity and lightweight nature, making it popular among developers for building fast and scalable web applications. 
   - Express.js provides a powerful and flexible framework for building web applications and APIs in Node.js. 
     Its simplicity, routing capabilities, middleware system, and integration with the Node.js ecosystem make it a popular choice for web developers.

Q2. What is Node js ?

A: - Node.js is an open-source, server-side runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. 
   - It uses the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine that powers Google Chrome, to execute JavaScript code on the server. 
   - Node.js provides an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient and suitable for building scalable and high-performance applications.

Q3. What is MVC ?

A: MVC stands for Model-View-Controller, which is a software architectural pattern used in developing applications. 
   It provides a structured approach to organizing and managing the codebase of an application.

   i. Model: The model represents the data and business logic of the application. 
      It encapsulates the data and provides methods for manipulating and accessing that data.
      It handles tasks such as data validation, database interactions, and business rules.

  ii. View: The view is responsible for rendering the user interface and presenting the data to the user. 
      It displays the information to the user and captures user input.
      In web applications, views are typically HTML templates combined with dynamic content generated by the controller.

 iii. Controller: The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.
      It receives user input from the view, processes it, and updates the model accordingly. 
      It also retrieves data from the model and passes it to the view for display. 
      The controller coordinates the flow of data and handles application logic.

   - The MVC pattern promotes separation of concerns, where each component has a distinct responsibility. 
     This separation allows for easier maintenance, reusability of code, and the ability to make changes to one component without affecting the others.

Q4. What is HTTP Status Code ?

A: - HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers that are returned by a server in response to a client's request made over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). 
   - These status codes provide information about the result and status of the requested HTTP operation.
   - HTTP status codes provide a standardized way to communicate the result and status of HTTP requests and responses between clients and servers. 
   - They help troubleshoot issues, indicate successful or unsuccessful requests, and provide additional information about the state of the communication.

Q5. What is HTTP routing ?

A: - HTTP routes, also known as URL routing or simply routing, are a mechanism used in web development to determine how an HTTP server responds to different incoming requests.
   - Routing enables the server to match the requested URL or path of a client's request to specific code or handlers that will process and generate the appropriate response.

Q6. What is the difference between Mongodb ans Mongoose ?

A: - MongoDB:
     MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable document-oriented data model.
     It stores data in the form of JSON-like documents, which can vary in structure, allowing for schema flexibility.
     MongoDB is known for its ability to handle large volumes of data and high write/read throughput.

   - Mongoose:
     Mongoose, on the other hand, is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js 
     that provides a higher-level abstraction and additional features when working with MongoDB.
     It simplifies the interaction with MongoDB by adding a layer of structure and validation on top of the database.
     
Q7. What is API ?
A: -API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.
    APIs define the methods and formats for requesting and exchanging data between applications.
