**************Variables*********************************

- In JavaScript, variables work as a container where we can store data or values which can be manipulated or accessed throughout the code. 
- JavaScript provide three keyword to declare a variable,
        1. var
        2. let
        3. const

- Variable names must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).
- These keywords have there own scope of accesability.
- Variables declared with 'var' and 'let' can be reassigned to new values.
- Variables declared with 'const' cannot be reassigned once a value is assigned(for premitive datatype).
  For non-primitive we can modify the values of the variable, declared with const keyword.


Variables with 'var' keyword
----------------------------

- It have function scope or global scope based on the declaration.
- Variable declared outside of the function or outside of any block will have the global scope for which we can access it anywhere in that code.
- Variables declared with var inside a function are locally scoped to that function.
- They are accessible within the function and any nested functions or blocks inside that function.
- It allows Hoisting.

Variables with 'let' keyword
----------------------------

- Variables declared with 'let' are block-scoped, which means they are limited in scope to the block they are declared in.
- Due to block scoped, we can access the variable declared with 'let' keyword only inside the block or inside the function.
- We can reinitialise or reassign a value to a let variable.
- But we can't redeclare the same variable with 'let' keyword.
- It doesn't allow Hoisting. 

Variables with 'const' keyword
------------------------------

- Like variables declared with let, const variables are block-scoped.
- They are limited in scope to the block they are declared in, whether it's a loop, if statement, or standalone block.
- Variables declared with const must be initialized with a value at the time of declaration.
- Once assigned, the value of a const variable cannot be changed or reassigned for the primitive datatypes.
- But still we can modify an array or object which is declared with 'const' keyword.

Hoisting in JavaScript
----------------------

- When our javascript codes are getting compile, 
  all the functions and variable declarations of your code are going to scanned and stored inside a javascript data structure,
  called as Lexical Environment. So that they can be used even before they are actually declared in the source code.
- A lexical environment is a data structure that holds identifier-variable mapping. (here identifier refers to the name of variables/functions,
  and the variable is the reference to actual object or primitive value).
- So basically it means Lexical Environment is the place where functions and variables live during the program execution.
- JavaScript only stores function and variable declarations in the memory, not their assignments (value).
