* Promise 
  -------
  - A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.



* JavaScript Promise Chaining
  ---------------------------

- Promises are useful when you have to handle more than one asynchronous task, one after another. For that, we use promise chaining.
- You can perform an operation after a promise is resolved using methods then(), catch() and finally().


* then()
  ------
    - The then() method is used with the callback when the promise is successfully fulfilled or resolved.

* Catch()
  -------
  - The catch() method is used with the callback when the promise is rejected or if an error occurs.

* Finally()
  ---------
  - You can also use the finally() method with promises.
  - The finally() method gets executed when the promise is either resolved successfully or rejected.
