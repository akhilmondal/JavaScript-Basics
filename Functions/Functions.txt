JavaScript functions
--------------------

- In JavaScript, functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks or calculations. 
  Functions allow you to encapsulate a set of instructions and execute them whenever needed by invoking the function.




Different types of functions in JavaScript
------------------------------------------

-Basically there are two types of functions are there.
   1. Regular functions
   2. Arrow functions

Regular functions
-----------------

- The function which we need to declare with 'function' keyword is the regular function. 
ex- function test() {
        console.log("hello Akhil")
    } 

Arrow function
--------------

- The function without 'function' keyword declaration is known as arrow functions.
ex- let func = () => {
        console.log("Hello Akhil")
    }


Different between Regular and Arrow functions
---------------------------------------------

i. Arrow functions are Shorter than Regular functions which makes arrow function easier to use.
ii. Arguments binding is not possible in arrow functions where as in Regular function it is possible.
    That means, in a regular function we can pass multiple arguments in a function without declaring them when creating a function.

iii. We can't use 'this' key to get the value with arrow functions. But it workes with regular functions.
iv. In Arrow function we can't pass duplicate name arguments. But in Reguler function it works. (a, a)
