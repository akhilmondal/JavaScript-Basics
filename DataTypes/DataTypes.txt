**************Data Types*************************

# What is data types in JavaScript? 
 
 -In JavaScript, data types represent the kind of data that can be stored and manipulated within a program.

# How many types of DataTypes are there?
 
    1. Primitive Data Types:

        Number: Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
                - let a = 200;
                - Operations we can do with number datatypes.
                    -Arithmetic Operations:

                        Addition: +
                        Subtraction: -
                        Multiplication: *
                        Division: /
                        Modulo (Remainder): %

                    -Increment and Decrement:

                        Increment: ++
                        Decrement: --
                    
                    -Comparison Operations:

                        Equal to: == or ===
                        Not equal to: != or !==
                        Greater than: >
                        Less than: <
                        Greater than or equal to: >=
                        Less than or equal to: <=


        String: Represents a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes (') or double quotes (").
                - let a = "akhil";
                        or
                  let b = 'Mondal'

        Boolean: Represents a logical value.
                - either true or false.

        Undefined: Represents an uninitialized or unassigned value.
                - let a;
                    console.log(a);
                //OUTPUT = Undefined.

        Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
                -When we want to make an variable without any values.
                 We assign that variable as null datatype.


    2. Object Data Type:

        Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs or properties. 
            -Objects can contain various data types and methods.

        Array: Represents an ordered list of values, which can be of any data type.
            - In JAvaScript The datatype of the elements can be different.

        Function: Represents a reusable block of code that performs a specific task when called.
